Simple History
Redux and React Redux are 2 different theroies
Redux is core liberary while React Redux is its implemantation
React Redux is used to wiring/Connecting so that 
Application can talk with each other
When we use Redux toolkit then most of our work has been
done
start
Firstly we create store 1 application has usually only 1 store
but sometimes make more than 1 store but its not a good 
practice.
It is called single source of truth
What is in store.js file
only configureStore like below code
import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';

export const store = configureStore({
	}
in tutorial we have only 1 key pair but more than 1 key is possible
Where will it take values?
It takes values only from reducers. This is only way it takes
values no other source it can take values.

Therefore we will make reducers
path/reducerFilesName.js in our example
todoSlice.js
Name is not considerable
to make slice we we function createSlice
To make a slice we need 3 things
name:'sliceName'
initialState:
reducers:{
	
}
import {createSlice, nanoid } from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
const initialState = {
    todos: [{id: 1, text: "Hello world"}]
}
export const todoSlice = createSlice({
    name: 'todo',
    initialState,
    reducers: {
        addTodo: (state, action) => {
            const todo = {
                id: nanoid(), 
                text: action.payload
            }
            state.todos.push(todo)
        },
        removeTodo: (state, action) => {
            state.todos = state.todos.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.payload )
        },
    }
})

export const {addTodo, removeTodo} = todoSlice.actions
export default todoSlice.reducer

Tell all the reducers in it where form it take values
Therefore code will be like
import {configureStore} from '@reduxjs/toolkit';
import {reducersName} from slicesfiles.js
export const store = configureStore({
	}
